ÿ+Explanation of Cricket.

You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.

Each man that's on the side that's in goes out and when he's out he comes in and the 
next man goes in until he's out.

When all are out the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and 
tries to get those coming in out.

Sometimes you get men still in and not out.

When both sides have been in and out including the not outs - That's the end of the 
game. HOWZAT!

If you understand the Cricket the above makes perfect sense, if not....
